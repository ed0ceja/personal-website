                        I was born in Cuba üá®üá∫ grew up in a small town close to Varadero. When I was 4 y/o my dad
                        taught me how to play chess, I fell in love with the game. I'm grateful to my dad for that. My
                        early childhood was pretty good: lots of play time and rigorous study.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Things changed a lot around my 8th birthday, family problems you know - Cuba is no place to
                        maintain a healthy family, in other words: I believe that Communism rots everything from society
                        down to the individual.

                        Thanks to my aunt, my mom and I moved to Miami, US soon after I turned 12 y/o. US felt like a
                        whole different planet with its own laws of physics, anyways, I struggled a lot learning this
                        language - either because I was too slow or the education system sucks in the US - I'm biased
                        towards the latter of course.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Continue pushing through alongside my mom - my little viejita is a f*cking warrior. Eventually
                        everything worked out and we got a house - God Bless America!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I graduated from Florida International University, with a BS in Economics and Minor in CS - 33%
                        waste of time - 33% worth it because I got to socialize - 33% learn some about economics and
                        coding.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I have worked in lots of different jobs: restaurant server - dish washer - bell attendant -
                        sales. Growing up I thought I was going to be an engineer but with time I discovered I like
                        people and words more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Right now I'm 24 y/o and life is good: I feel very lucky to be who and where I am. There are so
                        many opportunities and things to do that the hardest thing becomes choosing and obsessing over
                        just one of them.
